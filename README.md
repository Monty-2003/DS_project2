# Project Title

Analyzing Economic Metrics that affect Overall CPI Levels


## Description

The time series data is obtained from FRED. Each dataset consists of the change in the variable (e.g. inflation rate, commercial real estate prices, commercial real estate loans, consumer price index (CPI), and mortgage rates) over time. The data dictionary is sorted into each time series dataset we have found that relates to our projectâ€™s goal. We will explore key financial metrics and their relationships with CPI (Consumer Price Index), a measure of the average change in the price of consumer goods and services, to establish an overall economic forecast.

## Section 3: Instructions for reproducing our results

* preprocessing.ipynb
  * Import software packages (os, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, and pandas) into python notebook
  * Copy data files found in data.md into your own Google Drive 
  * Define and load book_data.csv and Books_rating.csv by connecting to Google Drive 
  * Determine each dataset's categories with '.info()' and use it for the project
  * Use '.head' method for both books and reviews datasets to return the first few rows of each dataset
  * Preprocessing (Clear missing values)
    * Rename columns and drops NaNs from important variables
    * Split helpfulness column for better understand
  * VADER Sentiment Score Assignment
    * Install '!pip install vaderSentiment' 
    * Create features (e.g. text_word_count and summary_word_count) for analysis purposes if needed
    * Save cleaned data
  
* modeling.ipynb
  * Download cleaned version of books_data and reviews_data (known as books_cleaned.csv and reviews_cleaned.csv) resulting from the preprocessing steps
  * Define and load both datasets in python
  * Establish the categories for the respective datasets with '.info()'
  * Import train_test_split and DecisionTreeRegressor to split the dataset and perform tests
  * Prepare the features (X) and target (y)
  * Create a DataFrame to show feature importance 
  * Evaluate accuracy of the model and calculate accuracy with a 10% tolerance
  * Generate additional metrics, such as mean absolute error and variance
 
* sentiment_analysis.ipynb
  * Merge the books and reviews cleaned datasets on key 'book_title', so that each review observation contains all associated book data
  * Statistically describe vader_sentiment variable and a visualization of the distribution of VADER sentiment scores
  * Create categorical variable of positive, negative, and neutral to visualize overall sentiment trends
  * Investigate negative sentiment reviews (< -0.5) and their associated review scores
  * Evaluate breakdown of books with most recieved negative sentiment reviews
  * Evaluate breakdown of authors with most recieved negative sentiment reviews
  * Explore distribution of each review sentment category with boxplot
